# Architecture — Sound Engine

This document describes the browser-based Web Audio engine.

For the overall system architecture (Frontend → Server → Browser Audio), see `README.md`.
For the frontend module structure (7 ES modules: config, landcover, ui, map, websocket, audio-engine, main), see `docs/devlog/M2/2026-02-20-frontend-module-split.md` and `docs/devlog/M3/2026-02-21-web-audio-migration.md`.
For sound design rationale and task specs, see `docs/plans/M2/2026-02-19-M2-sound-design-plan.md`.

## Bus Fold-Mapping (11 LC Classes → 5 Audio Buses)

Eleven ESA WorldCover land cover classes are folded into five audio buses:

```
Tree bus  = LC 10 (Tree) + 20 (Shrub) + 30 (Grass) + 90 (Wetland) + 95 (Mangrove) + 100 (Moss)
Crop bus  = LC 40 (Cropland)
Urban bus = LC 50 (Urban)
Bare bus  = LC 60 (Bare)
Water bus = max( LC 70 (Snow/Ice) + 80 (Water),  ocean level )
```

The Water bus uses `Math.max(busValue, oceanLevel)` so that open-ocean areas (where no grid data exists) still produce water audio.

This fold-mapping is defined in `server/audio-metrics.js` (`BUS_LC_INDICES`, `computeBusTargets`).

---

## WAV Loading

Five ambience WAVs are fetched from `/audio/ambience/<name>.wav` with progress tracking via `ReadableStream`. Priority ordering: tree + water first (parallel), then crop + urban + bare (parallel). Each `AudioBufferSourceNode` is created after decoding and set to `loop = true`. These WAV assets are local and gitignored (`frontend/audio/ambience/*.wav`), so a fresh clone must provide them manually; missing files surface as per-bus load errors in the UI.

---

## EMA Smoothing

Formula: `alpha = 1 - exp(-dt / 500)`. Timing uses `performance.now()`, not rAF timestamps. If `dt > 2000ms` (snap threshold), values jump directly to target. The `requestAnimationFrame` loop reads smoothed values and writes them to `GainNode.gain`.

---

## Three-Level Ocean Detection

Produces a raw target level based on the absence of grid data (ocean has no grids, so `coverage ≈ 0`).

| Condition                              | Target | Meaning                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `proximity == 0`                       | 1.0    | Pure ocean — no grids at all      |
| `coverage < 0.1` AND `proximity > 0.7` | 0.7    | Coastal — mostly ocean, some land |
| Otherwise                              | 0.0    | Land — sufficient data coverage   |

The target is EMA-smoothed with the same formula (default 500 ms). The output is combined with the Water bus LC value via `Math.max()`.

---

## Idle Behavior

If `update()` is not called (for example, map is stationary), the engine keeps the last smoothed bus values and continues loop playback. It does not auto-fade to silence on idle; suspension is only driven by explicit user stop or tab visibility changes.

---

## Visibility Handling

On `document.hidden`: cancel rAF and suspend `AudioContext`. On visible (if user hasn't explicitly stopped): resume context, snap smoothed values to current targets (avoids jarring transition from stale values), restart rAF.

---

## Timing Constants

| Constant            | Value   | Location        | Purpose                          |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `SMOOTHING_TIME_MS` | 500 ms  | audio-engine.js | EMA time constant                |
| `SNAP_THRESHOLD_MS` | 2000 ms | audio-engine.js | Snap-to-target when dt too large |
